# Jorge-Andres-Blanco.github.io
I am a physics student on my senior year, passionate about science in general, from data science to applied physics. Motivated to extract meaningful insights from data

## Portfolio
In this repository I publish some of my projects in data analysis and scientific programming

- Capstone Project, Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? (Google Data Analytics Certificate) **(R)**

- Coffee Introductory Data Analysis: This project analyzes the comercialization of coffee in the world, and makes a model to predict the amount of coffee comercialized each year based on other variables of the market. **(Python)**

- Solving some Ordinary differential equations (ODEs): This project solves numerically the trajectory of particles subjected to some forces using scipy.integrate to solve ODEs. **(Python)**

- Fourier Analysis of Signals: This short project contains some information of the fourier transform and its capability to extract information from periodic signals and removing noise, and an example using data from the GOES magnetometer. **(Python)**

- WO3: Analysis of experimental data: This is a notebook analyzing data from experiments on electrochromic films of tungsten oxide. The details of the experiment are not mention in this file, but here I process part of the data to obtain some derivatives of experimental quantities in order to see how well the results fit theory.

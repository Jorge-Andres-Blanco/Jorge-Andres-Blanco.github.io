I am a physics student on my senior year, passionate about science in general, from data science to applied physics. 

## Portfolio
In this repository I publish some of my projects in data analysis and scientific programming

- Capstone Project, Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? (Google Data Analytics Certificate) **(R)**

- Coffee Introductory Data Analysis: This project analyzes the comercialization of coffee in the world, and makes a model to predict the amount of coffee comercialized each year based on other variables of the market. **(Python)**

- Solving some Ordinary differential equations (ODEs): This project solves numerically the trajectory of particles subjected to some forces using scipy.integrate to solve ODEs. **(Python)**

I am a physics student on my senior year, passionate about science in general, from data science to materials science, and medical physics. 

## Portfolio
In this repository I publish some of my projects in data analysis and scientific programming

- Case study 1: Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? (Google Data Analytics Certificate)

The data for this project was obtained from  https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html from 2022-08 to 2023-07. The language used was R, and the notebook code is shown in the case_study_markdown.Rmd file. The file case_study_markdown.Rmd shows the output from that code. And a final report is written in case_study_1.pdf

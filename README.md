I am a physics student on my senior year, passionate about science in general, from data science to materials science, and medical physics. 

## Portfolio
In this repository I publish some of my projects in data analysis and scientific programming

- Case study 1: Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? (Google Data Analytics Certificate)

This project is about a bicycle rental company which wants to convert casual coustumers into annual members. For this task, it is important to first see which are the differences between annual members and casual riders. Therefore, here I analize spatial and temporal data of the last year's rides to see how these populations behave differently from each other.

The data for this project was obtained from  https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html from 2022-08 to 2023-07. The language used was R, and the notebook code is shown in the case_study_markdown.Rmd file. The file case_study_markdown.Rmd shows the output from that code. And a final report is written in case_study_1.pdf

# Solving ODEs using python, some practical examples.

Differential equations (DES) are present in almost every physics phenomena. Sometimes, thise DEs can be solved analytically, and the variables of interest could be computed using a formula. However, most of the time, the DE cannot be solved analytically and requires numerical solutions.

In this notebook, we solve some examples of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), that is, differential equations with one independent variable. We may use the ---- numerical method and compare with the analytical expression whenever there is one.

This small project is based on the classes of "Introduction to scientific programming with LINUX".

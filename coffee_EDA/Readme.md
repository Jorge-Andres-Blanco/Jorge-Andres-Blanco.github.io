This is an exploratory data analysis on the coffee market in with data from kaggle. We look for some relations between comercialization of coffee around the globe and some independent variables, like production, price, etc...

The conclusions of this small project were:

- The results show that coffee is a highly inelastic product
- As expected, the variables that have the higher influence for the comercialization of coffee are its production and consumption
- One can see some trends between the studied variables and the global coffee trade. However, it is very difficult to predict some variables specific to this market and the great uncertainty in this regard should be highlighted.

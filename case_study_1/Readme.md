# Case study 1: How does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success
This project is about a bicycle rental company which wants to convert casual coustumers into annual members. For this task, it is important to first see which are the differences between annual members and casual riders. Therefore, here I analize spatial and temporal data of the last year's rides to see how these populations behave differently from each other.

The data for this project was obtained from  https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html from 2022-08 to 2023-07. The language used was R, and the notebook with the code and part of the analysis code is shown in the notebook_r_markdown.Rmd file. The file compiled_r_notebook.html shows the compiled notebook. And a final report is written in case_study_1_report.pdf
